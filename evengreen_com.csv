"Marian Giovannini2 reviewsUSJul 18, 2024Disappointed I was very disappointed to be denied a credit card from Evergreen. We successfully paid our boat loan with them and were looking for a good credit card to transfer a higher interest one. We are homeowners with no mortgage who have been with Evergreen for 5 years. Maybe it's because we are retired?Date of experience: July 18, 2024Reply from Evergreen Credit UnionJul 18, 2024Hi Marian,We understand how frustrating it can be to be denied for lending opportunities. It is never our intention to deny you from a card or loan. We are happy to work with you to make sure that next time you apply for a credit card with us that there is a very high chance you will be approved. If you have any questions about the card approval process, we encourage you to speak with an Evergreen team member at  your nearest branch.Best,EmmaEvergreen CU",2024-07-18T15:43:33.000Z,"<div class=""star-rating_starRating__4rrcf star-rating_medium__iN6Ty""><img alt=""Rated 1 out of 5 stars"" src=""https://cdn.trustpilot.net/brand-assets/4.1.0/stars/stars-1.svg""/></div>",Disappointed,I was very disappointed to be denied a credit card from Evergreen.

You can download your statements as PDFs anytime through our Online Banking services. On your desktop computer, visit egcu.org and log into Online Banking.

"LELindsay Edwards1 reviewUSMay 23, 2024VerifiedBest Ever Banking Experience Casey has been amazing to work with. I have been waiting for a vehicle to arrive for months and through the entire process, Casey has been informative, responsive and friendly. I am a first time customer and I am so impressed. When I told the finance department at the dealership our rate, they said they wouldn’t even try to match it because they couldn’t get close. My husband is a veteran and we really appreciate the rate discount. It’s an incredible thing to do. Thank you for being the bright side of buying a car.

"KEKen1 reviewSEApr 20, 2024VerifiedSecurity I called the Evergreen's Portland location on Saturday, 04.20.2024.  It seemed a log in change had been made which asked if I were an adult.  The posting was done by Cloudflare.  The potential for a possible scam or worse gave me pause before answering.  The 'authentication' (I guess) somehow gave sufficient proof so I was then able to log into my account.I also had a rather minor request to edit the names on specific accounts.My call was taken by Danielle and together we were able to address and resolve.Having employees who feel professional yet personable service are critical in securing confidence in both Evergreen and their employees.Your mission and mine were met by Danielle.Date of experience: April 20, 2024Reply from Evergreen Credit UnionMay 6, 2024Hi Ken,Thank you for sharing you Evergreen Experience with us!
